Dear Kiwawa,
I remember meeting you at Anime Boston 2023 and being so completely starstruck that i couldn’t say everything i wanted to. Even now, I’m not sure how to express the endless amounts of gratitude and admiration I have for you. So I’ll say these: Every stream, I try best to be like you: trying bring a smile to everyone you can.
Hoping you have the bestest birthday, because you deserve it!
With Love,
Honeysaur

Kiara,
Happy Birthday! Thank you for all the laughs you've brought us throughout the years. Looking forward to seeing what you have in store for us in the future!
